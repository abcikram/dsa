What does Greedy Algorithm mean? 🤔

Greedy = Take the best choice RIGHT NOW

A greedy algorithm:

Makes a decision step by step

At each step, it chooses what looks best at that moment

It does not think about the future

It does not change past decisions

👉 Hope is: If I always choose the best option now, I’ll reach the correct final answer.
